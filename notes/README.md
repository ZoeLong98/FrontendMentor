## My process

### Built with

- Firestore Database
- React.js
- Tailwind
- Typescript
- Next.js
- vercel

### What I learned

This is the most complicated project I have built so far. I learned a lot by making it a full-stack app, such as realizing that I can't use express-session for authorization since Vercel operates as a serverless platform. The most difficult part for me was organizing the layout properly. The design of the note app is concise and beautiful, and it has two entirely different layouts for laptop and mobile views. It bothered me a lot to figure out how to handle navigation and state management. I ended up using lots of state, and I believe there is a better way to deal with it.

### Continued development

I haven't finished the authentication part, such as changing the password and email confirmation. Also, functions like creating and updating notes aren't smooth and still have a lot of room for improvement.

## Acknowledgments

This is a huge project that I worked on by myself. I didn't expect it to be so complicated at first and didn't work on it continuously. However, I managed to finish it and feel proud that I didnâ€™t give up.
