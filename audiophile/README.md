## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

### What I learned

I had trouble while dealing with Image (from Next/image), tryed a a lot of combination of layout and ObjectFit. Finally, I figured out that

```js
layout="responsive"
objectFit="cover" or "contain"
```

can satisfy most of my needs.
