## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- React

### What I learned

The orders of components for mobile and laptop view are very different. At first, I thought maybe write two different files for different layout, but as functions added in, it became difficult and unnecessary. So finally, I just used order, relative and absolute.

The other thing I learned is how to write recursive JS, dealing with nested comments.
